# fs-calorie-counter

Sometimes when you're coding a web application, you'll need to be able to accept input from a user. In this calorie counter workshop, you'll practice how to validate user input, perform calculations based on that input, and dynamically update your interface to display the results.

You'll also practice basic regular expressions, template literals, the addEventListener() method, and more.
